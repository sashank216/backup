Machine Learning:

Three Types:

Supervised

Unsupervised

Reinforcment

Supervised has two types:

Classification,  Regression

Classification: The data has a limit 

Regression: The data of prediction is vast

Linear Regrssion:

Here it is used to predict the z(contiuous quantity), where we predict the depdendent variable (y) based on values of independent varibale (x)

equation used: 

Y (dependent varibale) =b0(Y intercept) + b1(slope) x(independent variable) + e (error)

Y = b0 + b1x + e

Logistic Regression:To solve classification problem

Logistic Regression is a method used to predict a dependent variable, given a set of independent varibales , such that the dependent varibale is categorical


In linear regression: Dependent variable is always continuous

In logistic regression: dependent varibale is always categorical( can hold the values 1 or 0 binary), linear regression does not have this capability


The resultant or the outcome is always continuous  in linear regression

The resultant or the outcome is always binary in logistic regression

equation:
log(Y/1-Y) = C + B1X1 + B2X2 + .....

. Y is the probability of an event to happen which you are trying to predict

. x1, x2 are the independent varibales which determine the occurence of an event i.e Y

. C is the constant term which will be the probabiltit of the event happening when no other facors are considered

The curve in the logistic regression is called s curve or sigmoid curve


Linear Regression Use Case:

To forecast monthly sales by studying the relationships between the momthly e-commerce sales and the online advertising costs


Logistic Regression Use Case:

To predict if a student wil get admitted to a school based on his cgpa
