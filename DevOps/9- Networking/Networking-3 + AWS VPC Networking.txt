Virtual Private Cloud

Defining the size of the vpc: By defining the ip addr range

255 x 255 = 65536 ip addr to instances or application

VPC -> has ip addr range or block

It is attached with internet gateway


Subnet: Splitting the ip addr to sub projects

private subnet: No access to the internet

public subnet: A user once access to the vpc

public subnet is connected to the vpc using internet gateway


Load Balancer: Where it sends the request according to the load

Route table: how should the request go to the application

Gateway: nobody without access to gateway to enter the vpc   

Security Group : Allow the access the application


If anyone is trying to enter the application private subnet first reach the internet gateway > public subnet > load balancer(request) > target group(attach the instance) > private subnet and application

The lb to understand the path the Route table: defines the path

Once the path is created > security group allows > private subnet

NACL[Network Access Control List]: Automation of security group instead of giving the security grouo configurations everytime , nacl stores the security configuration and provides it[applied at the subnet level]

NAT GATEWAY: If application in vpc tries to access the internet [without exposing the ip addr private subnet server or application

VPC -> has ip addr range or block

It is attached with internet gateway


AWS Security Groups and NACL:

AWS -> Shared Responsibility

Security group servers in instance level

Security Group -> Inbound and Outbound

Difference between NACL and SG:

In NACL the user can deny and allow the traffic rules

In SECURITY GROUP the user can only allow the tarffic rules



VPC:

Create VPC

VPC more -aws creates additional resources[public subnet and private subnet]
route tables, internet gateway
