1. Core Components of MLflow

2. Why use Mlflow

3. Who used Mlflow

4. Usecase of Mlflow


Lifecycle of Data Science project


0. Data Preparation  - creating etl pipelines aggregate data from db etc and store in db[mongo db]

1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Analyze the data , perform high level testing , statistical analysis

2. Feature Engineering - handle the missing values, need to check how many categorical variables is there etc...

3. Model Training - Data Scientists are involved

4. Model Validation - FUnctionality overlap with ml engineers and data scientists

5. Deployment - ml engineers for extensive deploymeny

6. Monitoring - Implement data drift , like model needs to be retrained


Data Scientists Leverage MLflow for:

1. Experiment Tracking and hypothesis testing

2. Code Structuring 

3. Model Packaging and dependency management

4. Evaluvating Hyperparameter tuning --> Train Model --> parameters

                                      --> Tracks Hyperparameter Tuning
                                            
                                         ---> Visualization Graphs


5. Compare the results of models retraining over time


MLOPS Professional:

1. Manage the lifecylce of Trained Models both pre and post deployment

2. Deploy models securily to the production environment

3. Manage the entire deployment dependency


Prompt Engineers Users:

1. Evaluate and exp with large language models

2. Create custom prompts and expermient 

3. Deciding on the best base model suitable for project requirement.


Usecases:

1. Experminet Tracking -> Trac parameters and metrics -> UI ->

2. Model Selectin and deployment

3. Model Performance Monitoring

4. Collaborative Project


We can use the MLFLOW from Model Training ---> Accuracy, Error, Training, Test


Best Model UI from Accuracy  ->  Deploy it
