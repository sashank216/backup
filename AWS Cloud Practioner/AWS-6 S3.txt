Amazon S3 ( Simple Storage Service )

. Flexible
. Store large objects using a key-value approach
. Also called Object Storage
. Provides REST API to access and modify objects

. Provides unlimited storage:
   -> Storage class 99.99% availaility & 11 9's (99999999999)durabiltiy
   -> Objects are replicated in single region ( across multiple AZs)

. Store all file types - text, binary, bakcup & archives:
 -> Media files and archives
 -> Application packages and logs
 -> Backups of your databases or storage devices
 -> Staging data during on-premise to cloud database migration


Buckets:  If you create a root level folder then it is called as Buckets
Buckets:  Used to store the objects(file, folder etc)
Buckets:  Ownership cannot be transfered
Buckets:  Names cannot be changed or change
Buckets: Directly cannot be deleted , we have to clear the objects
By default 100 buckets can be created in AWS account


Objects: Data(files or anything) store in the bucket is called Objects

S3 Versioning:

. retrive the data even if the file is lost
. maintain multiple versions of the same file
.  retrive previous versions of the object
. Only suspend no delete

ACL enable and disable - Public and private


Cross Region Replication:  One bucket(client) data will be uploaded to another bucket
                            Only update no delete

Bucket to bucket object transfer  the permissions will be provided by IAM

. Scalable storage in the cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Object Based Storage : S3 -> Cluster,Infra,WAR
File Based Storage : EFS -> Files Replication from one server to another
Block Level Storage : EBS -> Server Level Files and Tools

.S3 -> Global -> No regions

.Bucket ->  Specific region

. Objects are stored in buckets
 
 -> Bucket names are globally unique
 -> unlimited objects in a bucket

. Each object is identified by a key value pair
 
 -> Key s unique in a bucket
 -> Max object size is 5TB

------------------------------------------------------------------------

S3 Storage Classes

. Different kinds of data

 -> Medi files and archives
 -> Applications , backups of db etc.

. Huge variations in access patterns

. Trade-off b/w access time and cost

. S3 storage classes help to optimize your costs while meeting access time needs


Storage classes

. Standard               Frequently accessed data
. Standard -1A           long-lived , infrequenlt accessed data ( backups for ddistater recovery)
. One zone-1A            long-lived , indrequnelt accessed , non-critical data ( easily re creatable data -thumbnails for images)
. Intelligent- Tiering   Long-lived data with chaning or unknown access patterns
. Glacier                Archive data with reteival times ranging from inutes to hours
. Glacier deep Archive   Archive data that rarely, if ever , needs to be accessed with retrieval times in hours

Amazon S3 Glacier

.  S3 Glacier - Storage class  - Separat AWS service on its won

. Extremely low cost for archives and long-term backups:
 
  -> Old media content
  -> Archives to meet regulatory requirements( old patent records ect)
  -> As a replacement for magnetic tapes

. High durability, scalibility, security(encrypted at rest and in transfer


Amazon                S3                                                        S3 Galcier

Termninology          Objects(files) are stored in Buckets(containers)          Archives(files) are stored in Vaults(containers)
 
Keys                  Objects keys are user defined                             Archive keys are system generated identifiers

Mutability            (Default) Allows uplaoding new content to                 After an archive is created, it cannot be updated (Perfect for regulatory compilance)

                       object

Max size               Each object can be upto 5Tb                              Each archive can be upto 40TB


Encryption             Optional                                                 Mandatory
