IAM: Identity and Access Management
-> Authentication(the right user) and
-> Authorization(the right acess)
-> Root user: User we created our AWS account with
  . Credntials: Email address and password
  
. Things we will do now:
-> Create an IAM Group- Developers - with admin access
-> Create an IAM user - sashank30  - with group Developers
-> Login with IAM user - sashank30 - password: sashank30@
Add user to group - it has the administrator access

Regions and Zones

 Application is deployed in data centre
 
 Challenges: 
  -> 1. Slow access for users from other parts of the world( high latency)
  -> 2. If the data centre crashes
          application goes down ( low availability)
    
     Solution: multiple data centres

challenges: 
 1) Slow access for users from other parts of the world
 2) Region goes down

Solution:

Add multiple regions

Challenges: Partly solved : Slow access for users from other parts of thr world
-> You can solve this by adding deployments for you application in other regions in different parts of the world

Advantage of Multiple Regions and zones:
. Low Latency
. Global Footprint
. Adhere to govt regulations
. High Availabilty

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Availabilty Zones

. Each AWS regions consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs
. Availabilty Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links
. Each Availability Zone:
-> Can have one or more discrete data centres
-> has redundant power, networking and connectivity
-> Increase availabilty and fault tolerance of application in the same region
