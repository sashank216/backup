EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

.EC2 instances - Virtual servers in AWS

.EC2 service - Provision EC2 instances or virtual servers

.Create and manage lifecycle of EC2 instances

.Attach storage( & network storage) to your EC2 instances

.Manage network connectivity for an EC2 instance

.Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple EC2 instances

key pair 
-> Public key -> By aws
-> Private Key -> By us

Private key -> to launch the instance

EC2 instance connect works on only specific browsers

EC2 Concepts AMI - Amazon Machine IMAGE

The Operating system and the software for the instance important for the applications

Three AMI sources:
-> Provided by AWS
-> AWS Market Place
-> Customized AMIs: Created by user

-------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 instance family: Optimized combination of compute(CPU, GPU), memory, disk(storage) and networking for specific  workloads

Instance type:

.. m (m4,m5,m6) - General Purpose
.. c (c4, c5, c5n) - Compute Optimized
.. r ( r4c, r5, r5a, r5n) - Memory (RAM) optimized
.. i(i3) - STorage (I/O) optimized
.. g(g3, g4) - GPU Optimize - Graphics Processing


------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 Important Concepts - Security Group

. Virtual firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic to/from AWS resources (EC2 instances, databases etc)

. Providing additional layer of security - Defense in Depth

. Default Deny - if there are no rules configured , no outbound/inbound traffic is alloed

. Allows allow rules ONLY

. Seprate rules for inbound and outbound traffic

-------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 key pairs

. EC2 uses public key cryptography for protecting login credentials
. Key pair - public key and a private key
-> Public key is stored in EC2 instance
-> Private key is stored by the customer/user

-------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 Storage devices - Elastic Block Storage - associated with hard disk of this type

Monitoring - User can see the metrics - All the metrics are coming in because of the cloud watch

Cloudwatch - It is the monitoring service

EC2 IP Addresses

. Public IP addresses are internet addressable
. Private IP addresses are internal to a corporate
. You cannot have two resources with same public IP address
. However , two different corporate networks can have resources
can have resources with same private IP address
. All EC2 instances are assigned private IP addresses
. EC2 stop = public ip address is lost

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elastic IP Addresses

. Scenario: How do you get a constant public IP address for a EC2 instance
-> Quick and dirty way is to use an Elastic IP!

.Elastic IP can be switched to another EC2 instance within the same region

. Elastic IP remains attached even if you stop the instance. You have to manually detach it.

. Elastic IP remains attached even if you stop the instance. You have to manually detach it.

. Remember: You are charged for an Elastic IP when you are NOT using it! 
            Make sure that you explicitly release an Elastic IP when  you are not using it.
