Elasic Block Storage And Elastic File Storage



File Storage       Host Computer       Block Storage


. What is the type of your hard disk?
 
 -> Block Storage


. File Share 

 -> File Storage


Block Storage -- Hard Disks attached to computers - Can be connected to one virtual server
                 Can connect multiple different block storage devices to one virtual server


File Storage  -- Media  workflows need huge shared storage for suporting  processes like video editinhg

                 Share files in a secure and organized way
                   
                 These file shared are shared by serval virtual servers


.Block Storage: -> EBS, Instance Store

Instance Store - Physical attached to ec2 instance, physical located on host computer
-> Temporary data
-> Lifecycle tied to ec2 instance(Only some support)
-> Ephemeral Storage - Temporary
-> Use Case: cache or scratch files

ADV    - Very fast  no extra cost, ideal for temporary data
DISADV - Slow boot up , ephemeral storage, cannot take a copy , size is fixed on instance type,  cannot detach and attach to another ec2 instance

EBS -> Network Storage
-> More durable
-> Lifecyle not tied to ec2 instance
-> Provisioned capacity - How big ebs user wants
-> flexible - increase size whenever 
-> independent from ec2
-> 99.99999% availabilty and replicated within the same az
-> use case: run your custom db

Note: Cannot detach root volume

Hard Disk Drive  vs Solid State Drive

Performnace                     - HDD (Low)      SSD (High)
Throughput(Big data use cases)  - HDD (High)     SSD(High)
Great at                        - Large sequential I?) operations      Small , random I?O operations and sequenltial I?O
Recommended for                 - Large streamng or big data workloads        Transactional workloads
Cost                            - Low                                              Expensive
Boot Volumes                    - Not Recommended                                    recommended




.File Storage: -> EFS(Linux), FSx for windows,  Fsx for lustre ( high performance)

EFS - Auto Scaling, Petabute Scale, Pay for use
Use cases - Home directories, file share, content management

FSc for lustre
-> File system optimized for performance
-> High performance computing (HPC) and media processing use cases
-> Automatic encryption at-rest and in-transit


. Alternative Amazon FSx windows file servers

 -> FUlly managed windows file server
 -> accessible from windows, linux and macos instances
 -> Integrates with microsoft active directory (AD) to support windows-based
    environments and enterprises
 -> Automatic encryption at-rest and in-transit

AWS Storage Gateway  - Hybrid Storage on on-premise

. Hybrid  storage (Cloud + on premise)
. Unlimited cloud storage for on-premise software applications and users with goof performance
. Storage Gateway and S3 Galcier encrypt data by default

. Three options
 -> AWS Storage File Gateway
 -> AWS Storage Tape Gateway
 -> AWS Storage Volume Gateway

. Problem Statement - Large on-pemise file share with terabytes of data
----> Users put files into file share and applications
----> Managing it is becoming expensive
----> Move the file share to cloud without performance impact

. AWS Storage File Gateway provides cloud storage for your file shares
  
----> Files stored in Amazon S3 and Galciers



AWS Storage Tape Gateways

. Tape backups used in enterpriese(archives)
  -> Stored offsite - expensive, physical wear and tear

. AWS Storage Tape Gateway - Avoid physical tape backups

. No Change needed for tape backup infra

. Backup data to virtual tpes ( actually, Amazon S3 and Glacier)

AWS Storage Volume Gateway

. Volume Gateway: Move block storage to cloud
. Automate backup and disaster recovery
. Use cases: bacup and disaster recovery, Migration of appliction data
. (Option 1) cached ( gateway cached volumes):
  -> Primary data Store - AWS - Amaozn S3
  -> Om-premise cache stores frequenlt accessed data
. (Option 2) stored ( gateway stored volumes);

  -> Primary Data Store - On-premise
  -> Asynchronous copy to AWS
  -> Stored as EBS snapshots

---------------------------------------------------------------

Object Based Storage : S3
File Based Storage : EFS
Block level Storage : EBS


S3: Application Configurations Cluster(Kubernetes) INFRA(Terraform Infra) WAR(Jenkins)
EBS: Server Level Data  Store ( Files creates , tools store) everything in EBS
EFS: From one server(files) to another server(replication)
      

EBS:   df -h command in ec2 ( Volume will be shown)
      /dev/xvda - default path
      /dev/xvdf - attach extra volume

      fdisk  -l ( list of volumes  and list of block devices)


   Data in EBS

       EBS volume take a snapshot
       Snapshot should be attached to new server
       then the exisiting data in ebs volume will be moved to
       another instance


EFS: to install on ec2  command

sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
